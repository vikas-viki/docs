`so for nodejs no matter how many reqests come in regardles of memory assume we have 10tb ram, it would still take only at amx 5 threads to preocess everything given, the nodejs process dont use extra libuv threads or worker threads`

`basically, ulimit -n sets the maximum number of file descriptors a process can open, and each TCP connection (HTTP request) uses one file descriptor.`


# Node.js and ulimit: Connection Limits

## 1. What `ulimit -n` means

- `ulimit -n` sets the **maximum number of file descriptors a process can open**.  
- Each **TCP connection** (HTTP request, WebSocket, etc.) consumes **one file descriptor**.  
- If `ulimit -n = 1024`:
  - Node.js process can have at most **1024 open sockets/files simultaneously**.
  - Once this limit is reached, **new connections are refused** until some close.

---

## 2. Important nuances

- **Short-lived HTTP requests**:
  - Requests finish quickly, so Node can handle more than 1024 requests **over time**, but **not concurrently**.
- **Long-lived connections (WebSocket)**:
  - The limit applies directly; only **1024 clients can stay connected at the same time**.

---

## 3. Scaling beyond the limit

1. **Increase file descriptor limit**:


ulimit -n 65535


# Node.js Scaling for High Concurrency

## 1. Maximum connections per Node.js process

- Assume `ulimit -n = 50,000`.  
- One Node.js process can handle at most **50k concurrent open sockets**.  
- Exceeding this limit will cause the OS to **refuse new connections**.  

> Note: These are **concurrent connections**, not requests per second.  
> With short-lived HTTP requests, a single process can serve **much more than 50k requests per second** as long as connections close quickly.

---

## 2. Scaling to 1 million concurrent connections

- To serve **1 million concurrent connections**:

\[
\text{Processes required} = \frac{1,000,000}{50,000} = 20
\]

- Options:
  1. **Multiple Node.js processes on the same machine** (cluster module or PM2)  
     - Each process handles 50k connections independently.  
  2. **Multiple servers behind a load balancer**  
     - Load balancer distributes incoming connections evenly.  

---

## 3. Vertical vs Horizontal Scaling

- **Vertical scaling**: more CPU/memory on one machine  
  - Increases throughput, but **file descriptor limits and CPU cores still cap concurrency**.  
- **Horizontal scaling**: more processes or servers  
  - Required for **millions of concurrent connections**.  

---

## 4. Role of Load Balancers

- Distribute connections across multiple Node processes or servers.  
- Prevents a single process from hitting `ulimit` or CPU/memory limits.  
- Supports **graceful scaling**: add/remove processes or servers as needed.  

---

## ✅ Key Takeaways

- One Node.js process cannot handle 1 million concurrent connections, even with huge memory.  
- With 50k concurrent connections per process → ~20 processes needed for 1 million connections.  
- Horizontal scaling + load balancers are standard for ultra-high concurrency.
