# 🧑‍💻 5 Key Software Development Principles

## 1. SOLID Principles
A set of 5 object-oriented design principles to make software maintainable and scalable:

- **S — Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**  
  A class should have only one reason to change (do one thing well).

- **O — Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**  
  Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

- **L — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**  
  Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without breaking behavior.

- **I — Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**  
  No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.

- **D — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  
  Depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.

## 2. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Avoid duplication of code or logic.  
Instead, abstract and reuse to reduce redundancy and maintenance cost.

---

## 3. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
Design should be simple and straightforward.  
Avoid over-engineering when a simple solution is enough.

---

## 4. YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)
Do not implement functionality until it is actually needed.  
Prevents waste of time and unnecessary complexity.

---

## 5. Separation of Concerns (SoC)
Divide a software system into distinct sections, each handling a separate concern (e.g., UI, business logic, database).  
Improves readability, testing, and maintainability.

## ✅ Summary
- **SOLID** → Object-oriented design principles.  
- **DRY** → Avoid duplication.  
- **KISS** → Keep things simple.  
- **YAGNI** → Build only what’s needed.  
- **SoC** → Keep concerns separate for clarity.
