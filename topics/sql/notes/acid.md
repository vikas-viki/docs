# SQL Notes

## ACID Properties

**A - Atomicity**  
A transaction in an SQL database must either fully succeed or fully fail. A transaction cannot be partially successful and partially failed.

**C - Consistency**  
A database that follows all rules before executing a query must also follow all the rules after execution. Integrity constraints remain intact (e.g., foreign keys, data types, unique constraints).  
üëâ The DB enforces consistency only if you define rules.

**I - Isolation**  
The order of execution of SQL queries should not affect the final state of the database. Concurrent transactions should not interfere with each other.  
üëâ Controlled by isolation levels.

**D - Durability**  
Once a transaction is committed in the database, it must persist even if the server crashes or a failure occurs.

## Transaction

A **transaction** is one or a group of SQL queries that follow the ACID properties.  

Examples:  
- Bank transfer (debit + credit must both succeed or fail).  
- Ticket booking (seat must not be sold twice).

---

## Isolation Levels

Databases allow different levels of isolation (trade-off between performance and strictness):  

- **Read Uncommitted** ‚Äì Transactions can see uncommitted changes (may cause dirty reads).  
- **Read Committed** ‚Äì Default in many DBs, only committed data is visible.  
- **Repeatable Read** ‚Äì Prevents non-repeatable reads but still allows phantom rows.  
- **Serializable** ‚Äì Strictest, transactions run as if sequential (no anomalies).

---

## Common Transaction Anomalies

- **Dirty Read** ‚Äì Reading uncommitted data.  
- **Non-repeatable Read** ‚Äì Same query returns different results in the same transaction.  
- **Phantom Read** ‚Äì New rows appear in subsequent queries within the same transaction.

## SQL Benefits over NoSQL

- Follows ACID properties, ensuring reliability.  
- Provides a powerful query language with numerous capabilities (e.g., joins, grouping, filtering).  
- Best for structured data, transactions, and strict consistency.

## SQL vs NoSQL

**SQL Databases**  
- Structured, predefined schema.  
- Strong consistency.  
- Ideal for relational data and transactions.  

**NoSQL Databases**  
- Flexible schema, supports unstructured/semi-structured data.  
- Focus on scalability and availability.  
- Often uses eventual consistency.  
- Good for big data, real-time apps, IoT.

## Indexes

Indexes improve query performance by speeding up data retrieval.  

- **B-tree Index** ‚Äì Default in most databases, efficient for range queries.  
- **Hash Index** ‚Äì Fast for equality lookups.  
- **Composite Index** ‚Äì Index on multiple columns.  
- **Full-Text Index** ‚Äì Optimized for text search.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Trade-off: Indexes speed up reads but slow down writes/updates.

---

## Normalization

Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve consistency.  

- **1NF (First Normal Form)** ‚Äì No repeating groups, atomic values only.  
- **2NF (Second Normal Form)** ‚Äì No partial dependency (applies to composite keys).  
- **3NF (Third Normal Form)** ‚Äì No transitive dependency (non-key depending on another non-key).  
- **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)** ‚Äì Stronger form of 3NF.
