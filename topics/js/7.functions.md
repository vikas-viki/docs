`A arrow function remembers the environment where it was created, not where it’s later called.`

**`Function statement or Function declaration`**
```js
function abc(){
    console.log('asd');
}
```

**`Function Expression`**
```js
var b = function(){
    console.log('sdf');
}
```

*major difference b/w above two is hoisting, cause, second one is treated as a varible, hence assigned undefined, but the first one will be fine.*


**`Anonymous functions`**
```js
function (){

}
```

*these are used in the place where functions are used as values, ex: for function expression, callback function*


**`Named function expression`**
```js
var b = function sdf(){
    console.log('sdf');
}
```

*when we use a named function instead of anonymous function in js, but we can't use it(assigned function) call anywhere else*

**`Paramenter & argument`**

```js
function a(parameter){
    console.log(parameter);
}
let argument = 10;
a(argument);
```

**`First class function`**

```js
function a(firstClassFunction){
    firstClassFunction();
    return function firstClassFunction2(){
        console.log('dfs');
    }
}
a(function(){
    console.log('sdf');
})
```

*A first-class function is just a function that can be stored, passed and returned like any other data (numbers, strings, objects, etc).*


**`Arrow functions`**

*let, const, arrow functions are introduced in ES6(2015)*

**ECMAScript (ES) is a standard specification that defines how a scripting language should work — its syntax, types, statements, keywords, operators, objects, and behavior. ECMAScript is not specific to JavaScript, though JavaScript is the most widely known implementation. (ex: Javascript, Jscript, Typescript, Actionscript)**

```js
const a = () => {
    console.log('sdf');
}
```

## Function Currying

Currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a sequence of functions that each take one argument.

```js
function filterBy(category) {
  return function(item) {
    return item.type === category;
  };
}

const fruits = [
  { name: "apple", type: "fruit" },
  { name: "carrot", type: "vegetable" },
  { name: "banana", type: "fruit" }
];

const isFruit = filterBy("fruit");
console.log(fruits.filter(isFruit));
```
