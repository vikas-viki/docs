### SetTimeout

```js
setTimeout(() =>{
    console.log("sdf");
}, 3000);
```

**`The setTimeout doesnt gurantee that the code inside the callback is always printed after 3s, it all depends on whether the callstack is empty or not. If its not empty, the callback queue must wait, once its empty, the callback is executed.`**

we can block the main thread like,

```js
let start = Date.now();
let end =  start + 10_000;
while(start < end){
    start = Date.now();
}
console.log('sdf');
```

now the main thread is blocked for 10 seconds.

even setTimeout(() =>{}, 0), will not immediately, if callstack is not empty.
