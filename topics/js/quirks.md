    **Answer:** Unique and stable â€” helps React reconcile efficiently.

52. What happens if you use `index` as key in React lists?  
    **Answer:** Causes buggy re-renders when items change order.

53. Whatâ€™s returned by `useState()`?  
    **Answer:** A state variable and a setter function.

54. Whatâ€™s special about `setState` in class components?  
    **Answer:** Itâ€™s async and may batch updates.

55. Does `useEffect` run synchronously?  
    **Answer:** No â€” it runs after render commit.

56. Whatâ€™s the second argument in `useEffect`?  
    **Answer:** Dependency array â€” controls execution.

57. What happens if you pass `[]` in `useEffect`?  
    **Answer:** Runs only once (on mount).

    **Answer:** Runs on every render.

59. Can you call hooks inside loops/conditions?  
    **Answer:** No â€” must be called unconditionally at top level.

60. How does React identify re-renders?  
    **Answer:** By comparing virtual DOM diffs.

    **Answer:** Prevents unnecessary re-renders.

63. Whatâ€™s `useCallback` for?  
    **Answer:** Memoizes a function reference.

64. Whatâ€™s `useMemo` for?  
    **Answer:** Memoizes expensive computations.
