### Hoisting.

hoisted is the process, where the varible and functions are moved to the top of their scope. (just like what we've seen in execution-context).

unlike `var`, the variables `let, const & arrow functions` are not hoisted, meaning, they are not allocated with the memory, until, the line in which they are declared are executed.

`arrow functions aren't hoisted, because they act as a function assigned to a varible (hence, undefined is stored in those variables initially).`

```js
var x = 0;

a();
b();

console.log(x);

function a(){
    var x = 10;
    console.log(x);
}

function b(){
    var x = 100;
    console.log(x);
}
```

output will be:
```js
// 10
// 100
// 0
```

`since, the function has its own execution context, it'll first look into the memory component of its own execution context, before, moving one step above (the execution context, which called it).`

`it'll move up, until it finds the variable or it reaches the global execution context.`
