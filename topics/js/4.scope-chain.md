### scope chain.

`Lexical environment = local variables/functions + reference to its parent environment.`
`Lexical scope chain = the chain formed by these parent references, decided by where functions/blocks are written in the code`

When you access a variable inside some execution context (say inside a function), JS first looks into that context’s local memory (variable environment).

If found → it stops searching and uses that value. ✅

If not found → it looks one level up in the parent execution context (the one that created this function).

It keeps moving upward through contexts → until:

It finds the variable, OR

It reaches the Global Execution Context (GEC).

If still not found in the global context → ReferenceError: not defined. ❌

```js
function loga(){
    console.log(b);
}

var b = 10;
loga();

// outputs 10
```

cause b, will've the value (in the execution context), by the time the function is called.

```js
function loga(){
    var b = 10;
}
console.log(b);
// throws not defined.
```
