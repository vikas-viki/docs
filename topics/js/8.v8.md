### Js execution

Parsing -> Compilatoin -> Execution.

**`Parsing`**
here the code is broken down into tokens (all keywods, operators, syntax operators, functions, variables, values, braces are tokens).
`let a = 10;` (let, a, =, 10 are tokens)

The syntax parser generates the AST (Abstract Syntax Code, visit astexplorer.net).


**`Compilation`**

the AST is then passed on for compilation.
Javascript can be compiled or be interpreted(or both), it depends on the js engine that implements it.

Originally javascript was written to be an interpreted language.

// back to process
the AST recieved is passed on to the interpreter, which creates the machine code (in this process, interpreter takes help of the compiler to optimise the code, its like backnforth communication, it depends on js engines).

the execution is not possible without `callstack` and `memory heap`, they are in sync with garbage collector that uses `mark & sweep` algorithm
```
- Primitive values (number, string, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint) Stored directly on the call stack.
- Reference types (objects, arrays, functions)
```
